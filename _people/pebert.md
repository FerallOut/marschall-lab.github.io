bio: Peter Ebert studied Bioinformatics at Saarland University. After his graduation, he joined the group "Computational Biology and Applied Algorithmics" headed by Prof. Dr. Thomas Lengauer at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics as PhD student. During his PhD, Peter worked in the domain of computational epigenetics with an emphasis on studying histone modifications within and across species. In 2018, Peter started his postdoc in Tobias Marschall's group "Algorithms for Computational Genomics", switching from epi- to genomics, and later following Tobias to the Heinrich Heine University. Peter is now working mostly on problems in diploid genome assembly and on single cell analysis. Peter received the Ulrich-Hadding-Research-Award in 2021 for his work in the context of the Human Genome Structural Variation Consortium. A constant throughout the years has been Peter's interest in reproducible research and in research software engineering.
